# FEA Model of the Flexible Component

Model should be discretized along its length such that beam element can be used. At each end multiple fixed restraints should be used to represent the desired orientation.

# Model Setup

Model is both bent and twisted with many split lines across its entire length.

# Study

Non-linear time history

# Restraints

fixed restraints at one end. Fixed restraint using time history to path points

# Mesh

Beam elements
